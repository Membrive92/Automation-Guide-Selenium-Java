This framework is build from basic, using bad practices and starting tests until finishing an readable, scalable and maintanable framework

Bad practice that are fix:

- Hardcoded test data
- Hardcoded static Text
- Hardcoded driver executable path
- Code duplication
- Non-Atomic test
- Non-readable test
- Duplicate steps tests
- User state dependence
- Stale intances when failures
- Multiple enviroment support
- Multiple browser support
- Static sleeps
- Poor readibility
